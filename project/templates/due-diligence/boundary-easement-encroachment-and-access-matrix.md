# Boundary, easement, encroachment and access matrix

`DD-008` · due-diligence · service code `LND`

> **Parcel-specific.** Create one copy per candidate parcel under `working/candidate-parcels/<parcel-id>/`. Do not complete this template in place.

## Purpose

Matrix of boundary, easement, encroachment and access findings, and what each does to the buildable envelope.

## When to use it

On receipt of the survey.

## Required inputs

- Survey
- `DD-004` exception register
- Zoning dimensional standards

## Instructions

- One row per condition, each stating its effect on the envelope in feet, not in adjectives.
- Legal access is a separate question from physical access. Establish both.
- Any conclusion reserved to a licensed discipline comes from that professional, not from this artifact.
- A condition not yet checked is recorded `not_found` or `blocked` — never `verified`, never blank.

## Completion criteria

This artifact is complete when **all** of the following hold:

- Every condition mapped to an envelope effect
- Legal and physical access separately established

An item that has not been checked is recorded as `not_found` or `blocked` — never left blank
and never recorded as `verified`. Unknown conditions do not default to clear.

## Sources

_No external requirements cited. If this artifact starts asserting one, add a row to `source-register.csv` first._

## Unresolved questions

_None recorded. Add any question that would change a decision if answered differently._

## Approvals and professional review

- **Required reviewer: `licensed_surveyor`.** `legal_review_required: true` — every stage gate this artifact feeds is blocked until that review is recorded in `GOV-015` (professional-review tracker).
- This document is an *issue-spotting tool*. It does not contain legal advice and must not be treated as a substitute for counsel.
- Record the reviewer, the date, and the scope reviewed. A review with no recorded scope does not clear the gate.

## Dependencies

**Upstream — this cannot be completed without:**

- `DD-001` — Due-diligence plan and deadline calculator


## Typst issue version expected?

**No.** This artifact stays in Markdown. If it ever becomes an external submission, a stage-gate package, or a controlled-distribution PDF, update `typst_issue_required` in `artifact-register.csv` first — the register is the source of truth, not the file.
