# Geotechnical scope and findings log

`DD-016` · due-diligence · service code `LND`

> **Parcel-specific.** Create one copy per candidate parcel under `working/candidate-parcels/<parcel-id>/`. Do not complete this template in place.

## Purpose

Scopes geotechnical investigation and logs findings — bearing capacity, fill, groundwater.

## When to use it

Before foundation design is fixed.

## Required inputs

- Parcel dossier `SCR-001`
- `DD-001` deadline calendar
- Relevant third-party product

## Instructions

- Prior structures mean prior basements. Scope borings to find fill and voids, not just bearing.
- Any conclusion reserved to a licensed discipline comes from that professional, not from this artifact.
- A condition not yet checked is recorded `not_found` or `blocked` — never `verified`, never blank.

## Completion criteria

This artifact is complete when **all** of the following hold:

- Findings traced to a primary source or a named professional
- Envelope, cost or schedule consequences stated
- Unresolved conditions marked `blocked` with an owner

An item that has not been checked is recorded as `not_found` or `blocked` — never left blank
and never recorded as `verified`. Unknown conditions do not default to clear.

## Sources

_No external requirements cited. If this artifact starts asserting one, add a row to `source-register.csv` first._

## Unresolved questions

_None recorded. Add any question that would change a decision if answered differently._

## Approvals and professional review

- **Required reviewer: `geotechnical_engineer`.** Record the review in `GOV-015` before this artifact is relied on at a gate.
- Conclusions reserved to that discipline must come from that professional, not from this document.

## Dependencies

**Upstream — this cannot be completed without:**

- `DD-001` — Due-diligence plan and deadline calculator


## Typst issue version expected?

**Yes.** A paired Typst issue document is expected before this leaves the project. Base template: `publication/typst/templates/rfp.typ`.

Transfer reviewed content to the `.typ` deliberately — there is no automatic Markdown→Typst conversion. The Markdown draft and the Typst issue share this `artifact_id`; the Typst metadata records the draft path and its SHA-256.

Compilation is not approval. See `publication/README.md` for the issue gate.
