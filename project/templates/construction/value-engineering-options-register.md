# Value-engineering options register

`CON-011` · construction · service code `EST`

> **Parcel-specific.** Create one copy per candidate parcel under `working/candidate-parcels/<parcel-id>/`. Do not complete this template in place.

## Purpose

Register of value-engineering options: proposed, priced, decided.

## When to use it

Alongside `CON-010` and throughout construction.

## Required inputs

- `CON-010` review
- Cost plan

## Instructions

- Record rejected options and why. Rejected VE gets re-proposed under budget pressure, and the reason it was rejected the first time is usually still true.
- Track the cumulative effect. Individually reasonable VE decisions can collectively change the product.
- Every figure states its basis and confidence.

## Completion criteria

This artifact is complete when **all** of the following hold:

- Every option priced with its consequence
- Rejected options and reasons retained
- Cumulative effect tracked

An item that has not been checked is recorded as `not_found` or `blocked` — never left blank
and never recorded as `verified`. Unknown conditions do not default to clear.

## Sources

_No external requirements cited. If this artifact starts asserting one, add a row to `source-register.csv` first._

## Unresolved questions

_None recorded. Add any question that would change a decision if answered differently._

## Approvals and professional review

- **Required reviewer: `company_decision_authority`.** Record the review in `GOV-015` before this artifact is relied on at a gate.
- Conclusions reserved to that discipline must come from that professional, not from this document.

## Dependencies

**Upstream — this cannot be completed without:**

- `CON-003` — Baseline schedule


## Typst issue version expected?

**No.** This artifact stays in Markdown. If it ever becomes an external submission, a stage-gate package, or a controlled-distribution PDF, update `typst_issue_required` in `artifact-register.csv` first — the register is the source of truth, not the file.
